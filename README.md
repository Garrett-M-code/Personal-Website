# Personal-Website

Hi, I'm Garrett! This is my personal website where you can find out all about me.

Feel free to look through any of the files. The website is currently in development and not quite finished.
It is being built using HTML/CSS and Javascript and is just a basic static site I have created from scratch.

The site is actully live, if you visit [https://garrettmoore.work](https://garrettmoore.work), you can see the latest stable version in action.

If you find any issues, feel free to make an issue or send an email.
